The goal of this project is to build a Keras neural network capable of recognizing a specific Chinese character. To achieve this, I used the Chinese MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten Chinese characters. The dataset was divided into two groups: a training dataset for building the model and a testing dataset for evaluating its performance. After training the model with the training dataset, I evaluated its accuracy and loss on the training data. These metrics were then compared to the results on the testing dataset to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
